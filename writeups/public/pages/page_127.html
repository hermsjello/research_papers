It was January 2021, when I received a private invitation to a <strong>VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Program)</strong>, it was from an airlines group. So I decided to try hacking in that program, because at that time I didn&rsquo;t give much priority to bounties, due to I wanted to learn and earn my first points on the platform.</p><p>After a few minutes investigating the scope of the page, I realized that they were using a unified login system for most of the companies that were in the scope, mostly airline websites, among others. I decided to analyze the &ldquo;<strong>Forgot your password?</strong>&rdquo; endpoint, first. So I entered my email and waited for the email where I would receive the link to change the password.</p><p>At the moment I received a link with the following format:</p><p><code>https://ââââââââ/password/?key=ââââââââ</code></p><p>After that, I went to the change password link, typed the new password twice, and captured the request.</p><p>The request to change the password had this format:</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/iambouali/c3287cb198ce14c2d62ef58634a1a138.js></script><p>I quickly realized that there was a numeric value (user ID) in the path, possibly autoincrementing, that could be susceptible to being used in a potential <strong>IDOR (Insecure direct object reference)</strong>. And I wasn&rsquo;t on the wrong track.</p><p>So, I decided to do a simple test, wich consisted in opening the following endpoint in the browser:</p><p><code>https://ââââââââ/api/members/314159/profile</code></p><p>To my surprise, my email was displayed in plain text. So I decided to iterate the numerical value and &mldr; wow! I was able to list thousands of emails without any type of authentication.</p><p>Listing emails with Burp Suite:</p><p><img src=https://tarekbouali.com/images/NKzR9jL.png alt></p><p>I wrote the report and just sent it quickly. The report was triaged as high impact vulnerability.</p><p>I moved forward to the <strong>API</strong>, trying to access more sensitive data. I had a gut feeling that I was close to finding something much more interesting.</p><p>Then I decided to try changing the password to another user by modifying their in ID request path. It didn&rsquo;t seem like a bad idea, right? So I created a new user account, to use its ID and see if I could find an IDOR with more impact. Well, with two accounts it is easier.</p><p>So I tried with:</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/iambouali/bc4af45a0588d1d250bda56dcaf4750f.js></script><p>I received in response:</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/iambouali/b7c0b579f41149e482bf70a3d3539e64.js></script><p>I kept trying options:</p><p><code>{"credentials":{"token":"MyNewPassword"}, "resetToken":{"token":""}}</code></p><p>Same error.</p><p>After several unsuccessful tests, I decided to fully removing <code>resetToken</code>:</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/iambouali/d47ce591971a31391f6998e307fec484.js></script><p>Then, I got a wonderful:</p><p><code>HTTP/1.1 204</code></p><p>I can say now, that moment felt so good inside that was without doubt one of the most amazing experience I ever had. After that, I decided to check it out if I had really changed the password to my auxiliary account and&mldr; yes! It was absolutly changed! I had a full account takeover in front of my eyes wich could be exploited on a large scale! ð</p><p><img src=https://c.tenor.com/Qjzn2f-rtdoAAAAC/thats-awesome.gif alt></p><p>After that I prepared the report, I sent it and asked very innocently if the report was suitable for a bounty due to its criticality. Being my first steps in HackerOne I still didn&rsquo;t know quite well which programs would pay and which wouldn&rsquo;t. This case was a VDP, so didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>But, after the triage analyzed it and assigned the impact, the airlines group team decided to move the report to another private program they had, a Bug Bounty program. They assigned for it a <strong>CVSS of 10.0</strong>, so I was paid the maximum possible bounty according to their table.</p><p><img src=https://tarekbouali.com/images/OK9TdkD.png alt></p><p>Amazingly, I was able to change the password of all or any user in the airline group. On all their different pages, was possible to save credit cards and other sensitive information. <strong>Therefore, a potential attacker had access to such sensitive information, such as credit cards, of thousands or millions of users!</strong></p><p>This was one of my first bounties on HackerOne and one of the most impactful bugs I&rsquo;ve found so far. For this very reason, I decided to publish it, even though I can&rsquo;t say the name of the company.</p><p>Happy hacking, everyone!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>674 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2022-04-05 01:51</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2023</span>
